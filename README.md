# Exhaustive search of numbers which are polygonal and a cannon ball number

In [a Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6L06pyt9CA) Matt Parker presented his results from a search he conducted for numbers which are [polygonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number) and a cannon ball number (Can't find a wiki article about those).

### Polygonal numbers

Polygonal numbers are numbers which, taken their number in circles, can be aranged into a polygon of given side count **s**.

The formula for a given side count **s** and a given side length **n** is

or slightly rearranged

.


### Cannonball numbers

Cannonball numbers are numbers which, taken their number in spheres, can be stacked into a "cannon ball stack" with a polygonal base of given side count. More mathematically a cannon ball number is the sum of the first n polygonal numbers for a given side count s.
